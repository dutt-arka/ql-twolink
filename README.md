# ql-twolink
"Two Link"--My code for RL applications at IIITA.
## There are three files in this section:
------------------------------------------------
1. **main.py** is the main coding file.

2. **env.py** describes the enviornment.

3. **rl.py** runs the reinforcement learning algorithms.

4. **plot.py** plots the reward function as a file(this is additional,for the special case--if we interrupt the program before 500 iterations.

5. The code runs for 500 episodes,this can be altered from main.py
-------------------------------------------------------
The basis of the robot and the theory can be accessed from [FloydHub blog](https://blog.floydhub.com/robotic-arm-control-deep-reinforcement-learning/)

The idea for this two link manipulator was forked from [Morvan Zhou's post](https://github.com/MorvanZhou/train-robot-arm-from-scratch)

For more about RL and the Robotics,I've written a blog post @ [my blog](https://feruxhi.github.io/thoughts)
