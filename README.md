# rl-theint
"The Intern"--My code for RL applications at IIITA.
---------------------------
## This repository (will eventually) contain hosts of code,links and documents related to my personal learning in RL and ML.
As of now, I'll be focussing on providing the code here, that's the basic premise of what I did.

----------------------------
For the time being, here's a list of wonderful sources of resources for RL.

**A huge list of resources for R/L and Q-LEARNING.(Will update more later lol)**
