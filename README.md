A two link manipulator (robotic arm) working on the principle of '''Reinforcement Learning'''

Done as a part of my internship @ CIR,IIIT-Allahabad,Prayagraj [Dec'19-Jan-20]

### ABSTRACT

In robotics, the ultimate goal of reinforcement learning is to endow robots with the ability to learn, improve, adapt and reproduce tasks with dynamically changing constraints based on exploration and autonomous learning. This report aims to the explain the inverse kinematics of a specific type of robot, the two link manipulator with itsâ€™ application through Q-Learning(a reinforcement learning algorithm). Finally, the report aims to do find an optimal solution of making a robot reach an end goal ,with the use of Inverse Kinematics approach
