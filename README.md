# rl-theint
"The Intern"--My code for RL applications at IIITA.
## There are three files in this section:
------------------------------------------------
1. **main.py** is the main coding file.

2. **env.py** describes the enviornment.

3. **rl.py** runs the reinforcement learning algorithms.

4. **plot.py** plots the reward function as a file.
